   1. **Sort out overall structure.**
      - Ordering of notebooks and worksheets.
      - Reflect this in the order below.
   1. `GasEqns101` -
      - A Notebook containing basic implementations of many of the Gas Transport formulae including:
        - Weymouth, AGA, Simplified Isothermal based on Colebrook-White
      - Also three simple case studies.
      - Leak Case is INCOMPLETE.
   3. `Gas Compressibility` (GasCompressibilityJT) -
      - Peng-Robinson. (Done 19/1/22)
      - Joule-Thomson Cooling
      - Includes some work for the Frigg Case Study.
      - CNGA section - UNDER REVIEW.
   4. `Gas Viscosity and Equations of State` - 
      - [x] Update Sutherland section. (Done 24/2)
      - [ ] Develop some questions for this - (calculate the viscosity of...)
      - [ ] Sort out the later sections of this worksheet and do some more questions.  
   5. `Erosion and deposition of (sand) particles` -  
      - [ ] Develop this into a worksheet.
   6. `Production decline curves` -  
      - [ ] Complete write-up.
      - [ ] Look at the Nutall code.
      - [ ] Work on (?unit?) tests.
